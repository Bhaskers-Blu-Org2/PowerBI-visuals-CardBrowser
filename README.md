# Card Browser
Browse documents using double-sided cards, and click to view in place.

Card Browser is a document set viewer featuring flippable, double-sided thumbnails for natural navigation of media collections. 

The Preview face of each card renders the headline image, title, and origin of the story with a text sample, enabling rapid discovery of documents of interest.  Flipping the cards reveals the MetaData face, which lists document properties. Clicking on a card expands it in place for detailed reading.
