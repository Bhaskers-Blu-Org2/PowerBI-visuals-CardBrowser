# Card Browser
Browse documents using double-sided cards, and click to view in place.

Card Browser is a document set viewer featuring flippable, double-sided thumbnails, providing a natural alternative to data tables for navigating media collections. 

The Preview face of each card renders the headline image, title, and origin of the story with a sample of the text, enabling the viewer to quickly identify documents of interest for further reading.  Flipping the cards reveals the MetaData face, which lists key document properties. Clicking on a card expands it for detailed reading in place.
